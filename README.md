# Create React Starter

A bare bones React Template.

This uses jsx instead of tsx as we've been using -- you can change to tsx if you want to use types again, but since you'll be on your own in this project and typescript errors can be a bit of a pain to deal with, this template uses jsx to make it less likely you run into problems at build time.

For this project, you need to make sure you have first identified a clear:

1. Purpose (what is your program for?)
2. Function (how will your program work)

Next up, you'll need to make sure that you write an algorithm that uses:

1. Sequencing, Selection and Iteration
2. A List, used purposefully
3. Procedural Abstraction (i.e. you define and call a procedure)
4. A Procedure that is called with different arguments to get different results
